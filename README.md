# 🔗 Convolutional Coding and Decoding Simulation (MATLAB)

This MATLAB project simulates **convolutional encoding and decoding** over an **Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)** channel. It compares **hard** and **soft decision Viterbi decoding** methods across various **constraint lengths** and **code rates**, analyzing their impact on **Bit Error Rate (BER)** and **Probability of Decoding Failure**.

> 📊 Ideal for researchers and students interested in error-correcting codes and digital communications.
